Test initial state:
--add exists
--remove exists
--get exists
--size exists

add():
--add 1 element
--add many elements

remove():
--test if list is empty (should throw error: "Collection is empty")
--test negative number(index) (should throw error: "Index was outside the bounds of the collection.")
--test if index is equal to list length (should throw error: "Index was outside the bounds of the collection.")
--test if index is bigger than list length (should throw error: "Index was outside the bounds of the collection.")
--test with correct index (element should be removed)

get():
--test if list is empty (should throw error)
--test negative number (should throw error)
--test if index is equal tp list length (should throw error)
--test if index is bigger than list length (should throw error)
--test with correct index (should return the correct element)

size():
--empty list
--list with elements
